/**
 * The collection groups and approval flows the three payroll policies are built from.
 *
 * This lives in `src/lib` rather than beside the policies because `src/policies` admits only
 * `+<name>.policy.ts` — anything else there is a `POLICY_NAME_INVALID` diagnostic, not a module.
 *
 * The grouping is kept, not flattened. Core's seed generated ~140 grants from four collection lists
 * crossed with action lists, and the lists are the statement: a company writes its own configuration
 * and only ever reads the law. Expanded to literal grants that distinction is unrecoverable — you
 * would have to diff two long lists to notice that `contribution_rates` has no `update` while
 * `pay_components` does.
 *
 * Each group is a **function over actions** rather than an array of names, and that shape is forced
 * rather than chosen. `PolicyGrant` is a distributed union that pairs each collection with its own
 * row type, so `{ collection: 'a' | 'b', action }` is assignable to neither member: TypeScript does
 * not push a union-typed discriminant through a union target. Mapping an array of names therefore
 * cannot typecheck without a cast, and a cast here would be exactly the wrong thing — it is the
 * pairing that stops a `where` from naming another collection's column. `grantsOn` takes **one**
 * collection as a literal generic, so every name below is still checked at its call site.
