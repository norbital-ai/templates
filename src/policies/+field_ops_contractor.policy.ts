/**
 * The contractor: their own profile, the jobs they were assigned, and nothing else.
 *
 * Every grant here is conditional, and the conditions are subqueries rather than column comparisons —
 * a contractor is a `contractor_profiles` row, not a user id, so almost nothing on these collections
 * carries the requestor directly. `$sql` is the form that expresses that.
 *
 * `${requestor.norbital_id}` is **not** interpolated here: these are single-quoted strings, so the
 * literal token reaches the database, and the policy compiler replaces it with a bound parameter on
 * every request. An unknown path throws rather than binding null, so a renamed scope root fails loudly.
 *
 * Use `$sql`, never `RAW`. `RAW` is a function; a grant is stored as jsonb and round-tripped through
 * the manifest, so the function disappears and the grant lands with empty conditions — which the guard
 * reads as unconditional access to the whole collection. A narrowing that silently inverts into a
 * widening is the worst thing a permission rule can do, so `definePolicy` refuses it outright.

/**
 * A scope change is a commercial decision, so writing a variation raises a request instead of a row.
 *
 * The ids are carried over from the seeded policy rather than reissued: `approval_config_id` on an
 * existing `approval_request` is resolved by scanning grants for a matching `norbital_id`, so a new id
 * would leave every in-flight and historical request unable to name the flow that produced it.
 *
 * The approver is named by `team.name`, not by `team.norbital_id`. A team is a runtime row, so its id
 * exists per tenant and belongs to whichever database seeded it — hardcoding one here put a private
 * identifier in a public template and made the flow unsatisfiable anywhere else, with nothing to say
 * so. Reconciliation resolves the name against the tenant it is reconciling and refuses a name that
 * has no team.
