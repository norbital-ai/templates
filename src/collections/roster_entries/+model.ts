/**
 * One person-day of the roster, which is the source of truth for what that day IS.
 *
 * A roster entry is a tagged union and `designation` is its tag. There are exactly two arms:
 *
 * - `WORK` — a scheduled working day. It carries `shift_definition_id`, and that shift carries the
 *   day's hours: its start, its end, its unpaid break and whether it runs past midnight.
 * - `REST` / `OFF` — a non-working day of a named kind. It schedules no shift at all, so
 *   `shift_definition_id` is null. `OFF` is a third kind rather than a synonym for `REST`: work on
 *   an off day is priced at the ORDINARY multiplier while work on a rest day earns the rest-day
 *   ladder, and collapsing the two misprices every hour worked (decision E27).
 *
 * There is no `PUBLIC_HOLIDAY` arm. A holiday is a property of the calendar, not of one person's
 * roster: `company_holidays` is overlaid at calculation time, so a newly gazetted day reaches
 * payroll without rewriting a single roster row, and the scheduling board draws it from the same
 * calendar rather than from a stored per-person mark. The import pipeline refuses a `PUBLIC_HOLIDAY`
 * row whose date the calendar does not know, so the two can never disagree.
 *
 * `+hooks.ts` enforces the arms on every write. Rows written before this shape existed may still
 * carry a shift on a non-working day; the engine tolerates them unchanged, and the first edit to
 * such a row has to correct it.
