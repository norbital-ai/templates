 * The ordinary rate of pay, and one day's wages.

 * statute says 26 underpays every overtime hour by 15%, which is why it is not a company setting.
 *
 * Two details matter for parity:
 *
 * - the numerator is the **unprorated** contract salary, so a mid-month joiner's overtime is priced
 *   at their full-month rate, not their part-month pay (decision E4);
 * - the rate is rounded to cents **before** it is multiplied by hours, never after.
 *
 * Normal hours in an overtime-rate day are the employment's contractual weekly hours divided by
 * its contractual working days. That is the employee's normal day; a payroll-system convention
 * cannot replace it with a different schedule.
