/**
 * Step 4 — MEASURE.
 *
 * Every plane of input — a contract, an entry, a clock, a formula — arrives here and leaves as
 * money. Components are measured in `pay_components.sequence` order, so the hourly rate exists
 * before overtime needs it and every earning exists before the grid sums them.
 *
 * Two rules hold throughout:
 *
 * - **an amount is a magnitude.** Direction is the pay component's `nature` and the treatment's
 *   decision; no line here carries a minus sign, including unpaid absence, whose type is `ABSENCE`
 *   and whose grid row is `REDUCE`.
 * - **an ineligible component produces nothing at all.** Not a zero line — nothing. A manager has
 *   no overtime row, rather than an overtime row of zero.
 *
 * `INFORMATION` components are measured, because later formulas read them, but they are not written
 * to the payslip: they are not money, the grid does not apply to them, and a report that sums a
 * column must never find an hourly rate inside it (plan 03 §2).
