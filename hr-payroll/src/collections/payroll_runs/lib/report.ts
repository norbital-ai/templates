/**
 * The workbook vocabulary.
 *
 * The customer's payroll workbook has a settled column vocabulary — `overtimePay`,
 * `proratedSalary`, `grossEarnings` — and the parity manifests compare those named ids. That
 * vocabulary is **presentation**, so it lives here, in the export path, and not as a column on any
 * model. A pay component knows its code, its type and how it is measured; it does not know what a
 * spreadsheet calls it.
 *
 * Everything below is derived from what was persisted — ordinary and statutory `payslip_lines`,
 * plus the payslip's own four totals. No output id
 * is stored anywhere.
 *
 * ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * NO JURISDICTION IS NAMED IN THIS FILE.
 *
 * A statutory column is produced by the contribution that charged it, not by a list of the schemes
 * one country happens to run. This module walks whatever statutory payslip lines a run actually
 * produced and asks `vocabulary.ts` what the workbook calls each one; a Philippine run therefore
 * exports `sssEmployee` and `withholdingTax` for the same reason a Malaysian one exports
 * `epfEmployee` and `pcb` — because that is what was charged. Adding a jurisdiction is an addition
 * to `vocabulary.ts` and no change at all here.
