/**
 * Component entries — the only door money enters payroll through.
 *
 * An entry's `amount` is always a **magnitude**. Direction comes from the pay component's policy
 * and from the treatment grid, and taking money back is an entry whose `origin.kind` is `REVERSAL`,
 * never a negative number. That is what keeps "is this figure a credit or a debit?" answerable from
 * the type alone.
 *
 * ## The reversal-sign bug this fixes
 *
 * The engine of record computes the sign as a single flip — `reverses_entry_id ? -1 : 1`. That is
 * not transitive: reversing a reversal yields −1 again, so instead of restoring the original it
 * **doubles the negative**, silently. Nobody has done it yet, which is the only reason it has never
 * cost anyone money.
 *
 * Here the chain is walked to its root and the sign is `(−1)^depth`, so a reversal of a reversal
 * restores the original exactly. The walk is bounded and detects a cycle, because an entry that
 * reverses itself would otherwise hang a payroll run (decision L41 / risk register #12).
