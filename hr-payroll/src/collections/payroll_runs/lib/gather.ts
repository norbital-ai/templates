 * they clocked and what they have already been paid this tax year.
 *
 * Only **live** rows are read — `norbital_approval_id IS NULL`. On this platform a null approval
 * stamp means the row is in force; a set one means it is still pending, and pending money is not

 *    relief pools with it. The 2026 population has no transfers, so fixing it moves nothing today
 *    and stops misstating tax the first time someone moves (decision L34 / risk register #11).
 * 2. **Draft runs no longer count.** There was no lifecycle predicate at all, so an abandoned draft
 *    fed the next period's projection and nothing recomputed it when the draft was discarded. Only
 *    `PAID` runs are year-to-date (decision L35 / risk register #8).
