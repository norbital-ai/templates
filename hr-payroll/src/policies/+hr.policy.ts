/**
 * HR administration: the widest of the three payroll policies, 79 grants.
 *
 * Kept generated, because the groups are what the policy actually says. `referenceGrants` with four
 * actions beside `statutoryGrants` with one is a rule you can read — a company owns its configuration
 * and only reads the law — and it vanishes into seventy-nine indistinguishable lines once flattened.
 * The exceptions are written out below the generated blocks, which is where the interesting part of
 * any permission set lives. See `src/lib/policy_grants.ts` for why the groups are functions.
 *
 * The three gated grants carry their approval config and step **ids** verbatim. Those ids are not
 * decorative: an existing `approval_request` resolves its `approval_config_id` by scanning grants for
 * a matching `norbital_id`, so reissuing one would leave every in-flight and historical request unable
 * to name the flow that produced it. Dropping the gate would be worse still — a reviewed payroll run
 * would quietly become a direct write. The approver **teams** are named rather than carried, and are
 * resolved to this tenant's ids at reconcile; see `src/lib/policy_grants.ts`.
 *
 * `apps: ['hr_controller']` names the app *group*, as the seed did. Eight apps sit under it and
 * `appAccessAllowed` matches a group prefix, so this is one grant rather than eight — and, unlike
 * eight, it still covers the ninth when somebody adds it.
