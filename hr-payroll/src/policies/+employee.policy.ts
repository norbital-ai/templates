/**
 * Self-service: an employee's own record and nothing else, 26 grants.
 *
 * The scope root here is `${requestor.email}`, not `${requestor.norbital_id}`. That is the seed's
 * choice and it is kept: an `employees` row is HR data with its own lifecycle and is not the same
 * object as a platform user, so there is no user id on it to match. The join is by address, folded on
 * both sides — `lower(p."email") = lower(${requestor.email})` — because HR imports and identity
 * providers disagree about case constantly and an exact match would show an employee an empty
 * workspace with no error.
 *
 * `${requestor.email}` is not interpolated by JavaScript: these are single-quoted strings, so the
 * literal token reaches jsonb and the policy compiler binds it as a positional parameter on every
 * request. An unknown scope path throws rather than binding null.
 *
 * `$sql`, never `RAW`. `RAW` is a function, a grant is stored as jsonb, and a dropped function leaves
 * `conditions: {}` — which the guard reads as *unconditional*. On this policy that would hand every
 * employee the whole payroll.
