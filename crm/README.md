# CRM — How It Works

![CRM workspace banner](assets/banner.svg)

A B2B trade workspace with two sides, integrated with the company's external system of record (a
third-party ERP or accounting system that owns the master data): the **sales side** qualifies accounts and
contacts, quotes from a product catalogue, runs the pipeline to won, and confirms the deal; the
**purchase side** raises purchase orders against suppliers and confirms the buy. Both sides hand
their committed documents across the boundary. One entry, no re-keying.

This is an executable Pod template, not a production-operations manual. It demonstrates a sales
pipeline and a buying pipeline with server-enforced document lifecycles, revision-safe quoting,
snapshot line items, money arithmetic that holds up to reconciliation, a cost-secrecy boundary
between the two sides, and a sync registry that keeps the workspace in step with an external
system. Start with the workflow below, then use the [collections](#collections),
[app](#app), [policy](#policy), and [verification](#verification) sections when changing it.

The workspace owns commercial records, tenant users, and policies. The host authenticates the
requestor and supplies external facilities.

## Orientation and boundaries

- **Sales owns the commercial record** — accounts, contacts, quotes, lines, and the interaction
  log. Sales people operate the pipeline; the policy scopes each rep to their own deals.
- **Procurement owns the buy side** — suppliers, purchase orders, and their lines, including the
  unit cost a buy is struck at. The sales policy has no grant for any of it, which is what keeps
  cost off the sales surface — Pod policies are collection-scoped, so the boundary is drawn by
  omission of grants, and the cost column lives only on the buy-side document.
- **The external system owns the master data.** Customers, items, and suppliers mirror _in_; the
  workspace never invents a customer, an item, or a vendor. Confirmed quotes and confirmed
  purchase orders go _out_ — that is the handoff the whole integration exists for.
- **The platform owns the plumbing** — users, teams, policies, audit trail, temporal history,
  notifications, attachments, import/export pipelines, integrations, automations, live query, and
  the command palette. This workspace authors domain models and rules on top of them.
- **Stock, warehousing, payment tracking, and ledger accounting stay outside** — see
  [Not in scope](#not-in-scope).

## The user flow

### Quoting

1. A rep creates a quote against an account: title, currency, tax-inclusive flag, validity date,
   and owner. The server assigns a sequential document number (`QT-2026-0001`).
2. Lines are added from the product catalogue. Each line snapshots the product code, name, unit,
   and price at creation, so later catalogue edits never rewrite a historical deal.
3. Each line computes `net`, `tax`, and `line_total` from the parent document's tax mode, and the
   parent's `net` / `tax` / `gross` are rolled up from the rounded line amounts. Lines left without
   a tax rate snapshot the catalogue's `tax_rate` at creation.
4. Trade terms travel on the header: `payment_terms` plus the shipping block (`shipping_terms`,
   `place_of_loading`, `place_of_delivery`, `packaging`, `shipping_mark`, `time_of_shipment`,
   `other_terms`) — free-text facts that print onto the document and cross the boundary with it.

### Sending, revising, winning

- `draft → sent` delivers the quote to the customer.
- `sent → draft` reopens it for revision. The server increments `revision_number` and sets
  `revision_of`, forming a traceable V1 → V2 → V3 chain instead of duplicate deals.
- `draft → won` and `sent → won` record customer acceptance.
- `won → confirmed` is the committed sale — the state the external system books. A confirmed
  document is terminal, which is what makes its figures safe to hand across the boundary.
  Confirmation re-checks the deal against the masters: the account must still be active, the
  document must carry at least one line, and every line's product must still be active — stale
  master data never books into the third-party ERP.
- Credit is **warn-never-blocks**: an adverse verdict (account on hold, or the document would push
  used credit past its limit) does not refuse the confirm — it demands an explicit
  `credit_acknowledged` on the document, which lands in the audit trail with it.
- `lost` and `cancelled` are terminal, except that a lost deal may be reopened to `won`. Cancelling
  requires a `cancel_reason`.

Only `draft` documents are editable — lines, prices, and terms lock once a document leaves draft.

### Buying

1. A procurement officer raises a purchase order against an active supplier. Supplier code, name,
   and currency are snapshotted onto the document, and the server assigns a `PO-YYYY-NNNN` number.
   The order's expected date defaults two weeks out.
2. Lines snapshot the product and carry the unit cost the buy is struck at — required, entered by
   the purchaser, and never derived from the sales catalogue. Amounts use the order's own tax mode
   and currency; a line left without a tax rate snapshots the catalogue's `tax_rate`. Inactive
   products cannot be added to a draft, on either side.
3. `draft → submitted` requires at least one line; `submitted → confirmed` is the committed buy —
   the state the external system books, and terminal. `cancelled` is available before confirmation
   and requires a `cancel_reason`.

### Receiving and purchase invoices

1. Goods receipts (`GRN-YYYY-NNNN`) record what arrived against a **confirmed** order. A receipt is
   an event, not a lifecycle document: lines cap cumulative received quantity at the ordered
   quantity, and remaining-to-receive is derived, never stored.
2. Purchase invoices (`PI-YYYY-NNNN`) book the supplier's invoice against a confirmed order,
   snapshotting the supplier and inheriting the order's currency and tax mode. Lines allocate
   ordered quantities (capped across live invoices) and roll the totals up.
   `draft → confirmed` is the three-way match checkpoint; `cancelled` requires a reason.
3. The `purchase_matching` remote returns ordered / received / invoiced per order line for the
   match review; cancelled invoices do not count toward invoiced.

### Billing, payments, and contracts

- Sales invoices (`SI-YYYY-NNNN`) bill a **confirmed** quote over one or more documents; lines
  allocate quoted quantities, capped across live invoices, and roll up like every other document.
  `draft → issued` requires at least one line; `cancelled` requires a reason.
- Settlements record money in or out against any committed document (quote, purchase order, or
  purchase invoice), currency-matched by the hook. Paid / partial / unpaid is **derived at render**
  from the sum of settlements against the document gross — never stored, and em-dash until the
  document is committed. The `settlement_summary` remote feeds those derivations per table.
- Contract signings track the confirmed quote's contract: generated → counterparty-stamped →
  acknowledged, with `voided` for re-signing (one active signing per quote). `binding_hash`
  fingerprints the quote substance at generation, so an edited quote can never ride under an
  acknowledged contract; the generated and stamped copies are platform file fields.

### Pipeline

The pipeline tab is a kanban over the active quote statuses; `cancelled` is hidden. An owner
filter, populated from `client.db.user`, re-runs the `pipeline_dashboard` remote so reps can focus
their own lane.

### Activities

Activities are polymorphic: `regarding_type` (`accounts`, `quotes`) paired with `regarding_id`.
One table serves calls, meetings, emails, tasks, and notes across every entity. Task activities
default `due_date` to today when left blank.

## The external-system integration

An external system of record (typically an ERP or accounting system) owns the master data — and
**the sync writes straight into our tables**. `accounts`, `products`, and `suppliers` _are_ the
mirrors: each row carries the system's own key in `external_code`, and the workspace reads and
edits the mirror directly. Confirmed quotes and confirmed purchase orders go **out** — the
accounting system books them, and its own references come back.

**Inbound — the ERP syncs over to our table.** Each mirror collection declares a `receive.pull`
binding in its `+integrations.ts`. The platform runs it on its schedule: fetch with the
connection's credential, parse the body against the binding's schema, hand it to the collection's
`import` pipeline, and write the rows the pipeline returns into that collection. The resume point
is the platform's own cursor (`integration_cursor`), so a missed window resumes where it stopped.
The import pipeline skips codes already on file — the unique index on `external_code` is the
backstop against a re-delivered page. Mirrors carry more than identity: accounts carry the credit
position (`credit_limit`, `credit_used`, `credit_hold` — available credit is derived at render,
never stored), products carry `spec`, `tax_rate`, and an indicative `qty_on_hand`, and suppliers
carry their contact and payment terms. Buy cost is deliberately not among them.

**Outbound — the confirmed document is handed over.** Each document collection declares a `send`
binding in its `+integrations.ts` that matches the `draft → confirmed` transition. A mutation that
matches writes the record to the platform's transactional outbox in the same transaction — a
delivery is never queued for a write that rolled back. The host drains the outbox: the collection's
`export` pipeline builds the payload (field-enumerated, so cost and other internal facts can never
serialize), the binding's `transform` shapes it into the request body, and delivery retries with
capped backoff and dead-letters after ten attempts.

The connection is declared once per collection and compared by value: `baseUrl` is a deployment
fact (placeholder until the tenant's connectivity is provisioned) and the bearer token is a
reference into `src/+env.ts` — never a secret in the workspace.

## Money arithmetic

All money passes through `src/lib/pricing.ts`, which is the only place rounding is decided:

- `roundHalfUp` rounds half away from zero via exponent shifting, so `1.005` at two decimal places
  gives `1.01` rather than the `1.00` that naive float multiplication produces.
- `lineAmounts` computes `net`, `tax`, and `gross` for a line, handling tax-exclusive and
  tax-inclusive modes. Tax-inclusive lines take tax as the _residual_ `gross − net`, so the three
  figures always add up exactly as printed.
- `documentTotals` sums already-rounded line amounts in minor units, so a document total always
  equals the sum of the lines a reader can see on it.

`src/lib/numbering.ts` owns document numbering: `nextDocNo` derives the next sequence for a prefix
and year, giving `QT-YYYY-NNNN` from one implementation. The unique index on `doc_no` is what
actually guarantees uniqueness; the loser's transaction fails and is retried rather than quietly
issuing a duplicate.

## What the platform provides — do not rebuild it

The Pod platform supplies a `user` table, teams, policies, audit trail, temporal history,
notifications, attachments, import/export pipelines, integrations, automations, live query, and the
command palette. This template authors domain models and rules on top of them.

Every quote and activity stores an `owner_id` holding a user's `norbital_id`. The `user.metadata`
jsonb column is the designated extension point for operational attributes:

```json
{
	"telegram": "@rep_handle",
	"employee_id": "SL-042",
	"region": "east",
	"channel_preference": ["email"]
}
```

Do not create a `users`, `reps`, `sales_people`, or `profiles` collection, do not duplicate
`email` / `name` / `phone` onto tenant collections, and do not hand-roll access control. Contacts
are customer-facing entities and are deliberately distinct from platform users who operate the
system.

## Collections

### Sales

| Collection            | Purpose                                                                                                                   |

| `activities`          | Polymorphic interaction log linked via `regarding_type` + `regarding_id`.                                                 |

### Shared

| Collection    | Purpose                                                                                                        |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `products`    | Sellable catalogue, mirrored in. Sell prices only, plus spec, tax rate, indicative on-hand, and main supplier. |

| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `suppliers`              | Vendors, mirrored in with contact, category, and payment terms.                                     |
| `purchase_orders`        | The buying pipeline: draft → submitted → confirmed, with cancelled terminal.                        |
| `purchase_order_lines`   | Line items. Snapshot product data and tax rate, carry the struck unit cost, compute net/tax/total.  |
| `goods_receipts`         | Received-against-order events (`GRN-…`); immutable, remaining-to-receive derived.                   |
| `goods_receipt_lines`    | Received quantity per order line, capped at the ordered quantity.                                   |

| `purchase_invoice_lines` | Invoiced quantity and cost per order line, capped across live invoices.                             |

## Apps

| App            | Purpose                                                                                                                                   |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `crm`          | Sales — pipeline kanban, quotes, quote lines, accounts, contacts, activities, invoices, invoice lines, contracts, payments.               |
| `crm_purchase` | Procurement — dashboard, purchase orders, PO lines, suppliers, goods receipts, receipt lines, purchase invoices, invoice lines, payments. |

## Policies

Two roles ship with the workspace rather than being seeded, so a fresh database has them and a
change to either shows up in a diff.

| Policy                | App            | What it owns                                                                                                                                             |
| --------------------- | -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `sales_rep`           | `crm`          | Its own quotes, sales invoices, and contract signings; quote lines, invoice lines, settlements, activities; reads accounts, contacts, and the catalogue. |
| `procurement_officer` | `crm_purchase` | Suppliers, purchase orders and lines, goods receipts, purchase invoices and lines, settlements, and the catalogue.                                       |

The sales/procurement split is drawn by omission, not by masking. Pod policies are
collection-scoped, so buy cost stays off the sales surface because sales has no grant for
`purchase_order_lines` (the only collection that carries a cost column) — and the buy side
gets no quote grant, so it never sees sell prices or margin. The shared catalogue grants read to
both roles and exposes sell prices only. Quote reads and edits are scoped to the requestor via
`${requestor.norbital_id}`; purchase orders are granted to the procurement role as a whole.

## Remotes

| Remote                  | Purpose                                                                       |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pipeline_dashboard`    | Pipeline cards enriched with account names. Accepts `owner_id`.               |
| `procurement_dashboard` | PO counts by status, committed spend per currency, top suppliers.             |
| `settlement_summary`    | Paid-to-date per document for one regarding type, for derived payment status. |
| `purchase_matching`     | Ordered / received / invoiced per order line — the three-way match review.    |

## Automation

| Automation           | Purpose                                                   |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `quote_expiry_watch` | Daily read-only report of sent quotes past `valid_until`. |

## State machines

Sales document:

```
draft ──→ sent ──→ won ──→ confirmed (terminal — the state the system of record books)
  ▲         │
  └─────────┘        (revision: sent ──→ draft increments revision_number)
won ──→ lost ──→ won (lost may be reopened)
won ──→ cancelled (terminal, requires a cancel_reason)
```

Purchase order:

```
draft ──→ submitted ──→ confirmed (terminal — the state the system of record books)
   │           │
   └── cancelled (before confirmation, requires a cancel_reason)
```

Sales invoice / purchase invoice:

```
draft ──→ issued | confirmed (terminal, requires at least one line)
   │
   └── cancelled (requires a cancel_reason)
```

Contract signing:

```
unstamped ──→ counterparty_stamped (requires the stamped file) ──→ acknowledged
     │                  │                        │
     └──────────────────┴────────────────────────┴──→ voided (requires a void_reason)
```

Goods receipts carry no status: a receipt is an immutable event.

## Extending the workspace

Additions should be explicit collections, remotes, integrations, and policies, never untracked
process workarounds:

- **A cost ledger**: a buy-side collection holding per-product cost (the source the purchase order
  line hook defaults its unit cost from), granted to procurement only — the extension that makes
  unit cost first-class without leaking it to sales.
- **Customer-facing rendering** (quotations and contracts as PDFs): the platform's export/print
  facilities, not a new schema. The contract portal for share links is likewise a host surface;
  the workspace stores only the token hash and its lifecycle.

## Not in scope

Deliberate omissions, each of which should be added as explicit collections, remotes,
integrations, and policies rather than as untracked process workarounds:

- **A separate sales-order document.** The confirmed quote _is_ the committed sale; spinning a
  second document out of it would copy facts the quote already carries — numbers, terms, lines,
  totals — and keep two lifecycles in lockstep for no new information. The quote's confirmed
  state, revision lineage, and cancellation reason are the whole lifecycle.
- ERP push states (pushing, push-failed, remote-voided) — the platform's transactional outbox owns
  delivery; the template sees confirmed → handed across the boundary.
- Floor prices, markup configuration, and cost on the sales surface — cost secrecy is drawn by
  policy omission instead.
- Commission calculations and customer-specific side models (blanket orders, aging exports) —
  bespoke concerns that do not generalize into a reference template.
- Exchange-rate sourcing and multi-currency roll-up — totals stay per currency.
- Warehousing beyond the indicative on-hand mirror: lots, bin locations, and stock movements stay
  in the external system.

Platform-level constraint worth knowing: `owner_id` columns render as raw UUIDs in
`CollectionTable`, because Pod relationships do not target platform tables. The pipeline filter
works around this by populating a dropdown from `client.db.user`.

## Verification

```bash
pnpm --dir template_workspaces/crm sync
pnpm --dir template_workspaces/crm lint
pnpm --dir template_workspaces/crm build
```

`sync` may create or update `.norbital/migrations/`; commit that migration history with the
authored change. Publish the revised template and deploy a new tenant checkpoint before it affects
an existing tenant. See the template lifecycle in the OSS repository README.
